A Full-Stack Developer in Vancouver, BC (Canada)

About Me
Hello! I'm originally from Japan but moved to Vancouver at 18, chasing my dream of becoming a professional hockey player. After graduating from university, I ventured into the world of talent recruitment, where I spent five years in both the tech and healthcare sectors. It was a fulfilling journey, but I felt a pull towards something more creative and hands-on.

That's when I decided to make a leap into software development. The allure of solving complex problems and building things from the ground up was too strong to resist. I'm particularly excited to see how I can blend the communication skills I honed in recruitment with my technical abilities in development. It's an adventure I'm truly looking forward to
